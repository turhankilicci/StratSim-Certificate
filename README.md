This project paper aims to conclude the prediction of the “Euro Value” of soccer players using various regression models. The full dataset was deducted to a smaller quantity of dataset and therefore, we used 35 predictors and 1500 observations (which 3 of them are categorical and the rest are numerical). The project goal is to predict which regression model is the best option to use and compose the dataset
according to it. After implementing the regression models and predicting each value of them after the analysis, we foresee the possible “Euro Value” of each player varied to a different set of variables. All in all, in order to foresee the “Euro Values” of each soccer player, we used “Multiple Regression”, “Ridge and Lasso Regression”, “Regression Tree” and “ Random Forest” models for our dataset. The conclusion has been
formed by comparing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) values of each model. The “Random Forest” model gives the optimal result in the end with the least MSE value.
